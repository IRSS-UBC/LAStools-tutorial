Hello, IRSS member.

I made this LAStools tutorial to allow people to get up to speed with LAStools quickly. If you have questions feel free to email Piotr at `piotr.tompaski@ubc.c`.

***Disclaimer***

I am not affiliated with LAStools in anyway. I have never been payed by LAStools. I am simply a post-doc who wants to help IRSS members learn to process lidar. If you want to know more please consult the [LAStools website](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).
